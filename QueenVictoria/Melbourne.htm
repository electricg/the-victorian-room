<h3>MELBOURNE, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount (1779-1848)</h3>
<img src="melbourne.jpg" width="175" height="243" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="Viscount Melbourne">He was Prime Minister at the time of Queen Victoria's accession. For the affection that
Victoria developed for him, the Queen was nicknamed &quot;Mrs. Melbourne&quot;,
even if the voices were about Melbourne's sexual reputation and not about
Victoria. He was defeated in 1841 after seven years of power.
