<h2>HER INFANCY</h2>
The symptoms of the terrible illness of King George III confined
him in<img border="0" src="dkent.jpg" align="right" alt="The Duke of Kent" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="167" height="272"> Windsor Castle while his eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled for
him. His brother; Victoria's father, Edward, Duke of Kent, was the fourth son
and as his brothers didn't have any heir, it seemed that this could be a
great occasion for him to became one day King. He married at the age of 50 only
to give a successor to the throne.<br>
Edward knew Victoire, Victoria's mother, thanks to the Princess
Charlotte, daughter of the Prince of Wales, married to Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, that suggested to the uncle that he would find an amiable
wife in Leopold's sister.<br>
Victoire was 31 years old when she married Edward and the
marriage seemed to her a great occasion to change her life, from the little
German village to the one of the great Court of Europe.<img border="0" src="dsskent.jpg" align="left" alt="The Duchess of Kent" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="188" height="255"><br>
In 1819 Victoria was born and her father was not disappointed that
the baby was not a male. She was named &quot;Alexandrina Victoria&quot;, because her
chief godfather was the Russian Tsar Alexander, but she was known simply as
Victoria.<br>
After the death of the Duke of Kent, Victoire decided to stay in
London with her brother, because her little daughter was third in line to the
throne.<br>
She passed her infancy with kind people: her mother, always
worried for the child's health, her half-sister Feodora, a constant companion,<a href="javascript:popWin1('duchknt.jpg', 'DuchessOfKent', 410, 530, 'false')"><img border="0" src="duchknt_small.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Duchess of Kent with Victoria as a baby" width="200" height="260"></a>
the nurse Mrs. Brock, replaced by Feodora's governess and numerous aunts and
uncles of the Royal family. Her character was difficult, she was naughty,
screaming and stamping. But after these fits of temper she was also bright
enough, quick at lessons and shrew in personal relationship: when her uncle
George IV asked her which song she wished to listen to, she requested &quot;God
Save the King&quot;.<br>
In 1831 Leopold went away from England permanently to take up
the crown of the newly-created kingdom of Belgium. Left alone and used to be
ruled by men, she was strictly guarded by Conroy. He had been the Duke of Kent's
aid-de-camp, a military man and a good-looking Irishman, with charm and
ambition.It was Conroy and the Duchess of Kent who insisted that
Victoria<img border="0" src="conroy.jpg" align="left" alt="Conroy" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="155" height="358"> should be strictly guarded and controlled for the fear of a fatal
&quot;accident&quot; by the hands of the Duke of Cumberland. And it was Conroy
too who find for Feodora a husband when it seemed that the widower King could
marry her and deprive Victoria a chance to become Queen. His only aim was
to be the chief advisor of the future Queen of England.After the
death of King George Victoria's education became more controlled and
rigid and only thanks to Lehzen the princess understood the significance of her
place in the royal family. And it was Baroness Lehzen too that opened the
Princess's eyes to Conroy's intentions. On 24th May 1837 she celebrated her 18th
birthday: from this moment she was free from the possibility of a regency and
closer to the throne.At 6 o'clock on the morning of 20th June
the Duchess of Kent woke her daughter with the news that William IV was dead. So
Victoria received, alone for the first time, the Archibishop of Canterbury and
Lord Chamberlain. All the accounts were paid: Lehzen became her
closest confident, her mother was left at home and to Conroy was forbidden the
access to her private room. Only after many years the Duchess of Kent regained
her daughter's affection.
