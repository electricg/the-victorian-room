<h2>HER POLICY</h2>
In the early part of the reign she was influenced by two men: <a href="javascript:popWin('Melbourne.htm')">Lord Melbourne</a>, her first Prime Minister, and <a href="javascript:popWin('Albert.htm')">Albert</a>, which she turned almost completely dependent upon when she began to have children; both of them taught her how to be a monarch in constitutional monarchy, where the power was restricted, but not so much as the influence.<br>
Victoria was deeply attached to her husband and after his death she sank into depression, wearing black until her death and making rarely public apparitions until the late 1860s. Only the urge of the family and the flattering attention of <a href="javascript:popWin('Disraeli.htm')">Disraeli</a> gradually took back the Queen to her duties.<br>
For her seclusion (but also for the high cost of the monarchy to the nation) she was criticized and a republican movement developed, that brought seven attempts to her life, which she confronted with great courage.<br><br>
<a href="javascript:popWin1('VictoriaNapoleon.jpg', 'Victoria', 620, 410, 'false')"><img src="VictoriaNapoleon_little.JPG" width="200" height="129" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="Franz Joseph, the turkish Sultan Abdul-Megid, Queen Victoria and Napoleon III"></a>In foreign policy she used her influence usually to bring peace and reconciliation, she pressed her Prime Minister to not intervene in the Prussia-Austria-Denmark war and her letter to the German Emperor (whose son had married her daughter) helped to avoid a second Franco-German war. She was also convinced that the Turkish hegemony was necessary to control the expansion of Russia.<br>
But after Indian Mutiny of 1857 the control of the country passed under the crown and in 1877 Victoria became Empress of India under the Royal Titles Act passed by Disraeli's government.<br><br>
In interior policy new reforms reduced the Sovereign's powers: a series of Acts broadened the social and economic base of the electorate (Second Reform Act, 1867); the introduction of the secret ballot in 1872 made it impossible to pressured voters by bribery or intimidation; all householders and lodgers in accommodation worth at least £10 a year, and occupiers of land worth £10 a year, were entitled to vote (Representation of the Peoples Act, 1884 ); her freedom to choose which individual should occupy the premiership was increasingly restricted. In 1880 <a href="javascript:popWin('Gladstone.htm')">Gladstone</a> became Prime Minister, even if the Queen tried to stop it for her favorites Disraeli and the Marquess of Hartington.<br>
In some aspects she was conservative, as many she opposed giving women the vote (it's famous her sentence <i>"We women are not made for governing"</i>); in others she (and Albert) was blind (the government over which Victoria and Albert presided had, in the midst of the potato famine of 1845, continued to permit the export of grain and cattle from Ireland to England while over a million Irish peasants starved to death). But on social issues, she favored the improve of the lot of the poor, such as the Royal Commission on housing. She also supported many charities involved in education, hospitals and other areas.<br><br>
<img src="v12.jpg" width="233" height="165" border="0" alt="Queen Victoria arriving at St Paul's Cathedral as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In the technological area Albert, with the <a href="../History/GreatExhibition.htm">Great Exhibition</a>, brought popularity and optimism in  Great Britain; Victoria was the first monarch to use trains (her first journey is dated 1842); her family travelled and was seen on an unprecedented scale, thanks to technical changes such as the spread of newspapers and the invention of photography; the telegraph permitted her to send greetings and thanks for her Diamond Jubilee in an instant, as she wrote in her <a href="Diary.htm">diary</a>: 
<i>"Before leaving I touched an electric button, by which I started a message which was telegraphed throughout the whole Empire. It was the following: "From my heart I thank my beloved people, May God bless them!""</i><br><br>

As in the Crimean War (when she instituted the Victoria Cross, a gallantry award that ranks above all other British orders and decorations and for which, from the beginning, all ranks were eligible - the criteria was an outstanding valour or devotion to the country in the face of the enemy; the Cross was made from the metal of Russian guns captured in the Crimean War), during the Boer War she reviewed her troops and visited hospitals; she remained undaunted by British reverses during the campaign: <i>"We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat; they do not exist"</i><br><br>
Victoria <a href="javascript:popWin1('Video.htm', 'FuneralProcession', 400, 350, 'false')" title="Click here to watch the video of her funeral procession">died</a> at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901 after a reign which lasted almost 64 years, the longest in British history. She was buried at Windsor beside Prince Albert, in the Frogmore Royal Mausoleum, which she had built for their final resting place. Above the Mausoleum door are inscribed Victoria's words: <i>"farewell best beloved, here at last I shall rest with thee, with thee in Christ I shall rise again"</i>.
