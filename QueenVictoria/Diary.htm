<h2>QUEEN VICTORIA'S JOURNAL</h2>
Queen Victoria maintained a detailed diary since the age of 13 until her death. This Journal contained 111 large manuscript volumes that constitute only a third of the original, as her daughter Princess Beatrice edited it following Queen's request. In this diary Victoria wrote all her thoughts and feelings during all her reign, giving us a great and unique document about her era.<br><br>
Here are some of the most important and significant extracts.

<h3>On William IV's death, and her accession aged 18 years:<br> Tuesday, 20 June 1837 at Kensington Palace</h3>
<i>I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me that the Archbishop of Canterbury<a href="newsvic.jpg" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="newsvic_small.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Victoria receiving news of her accession" width="350" height="251"></a> and Lord Conyngham were here, and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing-gown), and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain) then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen. Lord Conyngham knelt down and kissed my hand, at the same time delivering to me the official announcement of the poor King's demise. The Archbishop then told me that the Queen was desirous that he should come and tell me the details of the last moments of my poor, good Uncle; he said that he had directed his mind to religion, and had died in a perfectly happy, quiet state of mind, and was quite prepared for his death. He added that the King's sufferings at the last were not very great but that there was a good deal of uneasiness. Lord Conyngham, whom I charged to express my feelings of condolence and sorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly to Windsor. I then went to my room and dressed.<br><br>
Since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young and perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure, that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have ...</i>


<h3>Great Exhibition: 1 May 1851</h3>
<i>This day is one of the greatest and most glorious days of our lives, with which, to my pride and joy the name of my dearly beloved Albert is forever associated! It is a day which makes my heart swell with thankfulness ... The Park presented a wonderful spectacle, crowds streaming though it - carriages and troops passing, quite like the<a href="../History/GreatExhibition.htm"><img border="0" src="v7.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="The Great Exhibition" width="233" height="186"></a> Coronation Day, and for me, the same anxiety. The day was bright, and all bustle and excitement. At half past 11, the whole procession in 9 state carriages was set in motion. Vicky and Bertie</i> [her two eldest children, the Princess Royal and the Prince of Wales] <i>were in our carriage. Vicky was dressed in lace over white satin, with a small wreath of pink wild roses, in her hair, and looked very nice. Bertie was in full Highland dress. The Green Park and Hyde Park were one mass of densely crowded human beings, in the highest good humour and most enthusiastic. I never saw Hyde Park look as it did, being filled with crowds as far as the eye could reach. A little rain fell, just as we started; but before we neared the Crystal Palace, the sun shone and gleamed upon the gigantic edifice, upon which the flags of every nation were flying. [...]<br><br>
We returned to our place and Albert told Lord Breadalbane to declare the Exhibition opened, which he did in a loud voice saying "Her Majesty commands me to declare the Exhibition opened", when there was a flourish of trumpets, followed by immense cheering. Everyone was astounded and delighted. The return was equally satisfactory - the crowd most enthusiastic and perfect order kept. We reached the Palace at 20 minutes past 1 and went out on the balcony, being loudly cheered. That we felt happy and thankful, - I need not say - proud of all that had passed and of my beloved one's success. Dearest Albert's name is for ever immortalized and the absurd reports of dangers of every kind and sort, set about by a set of people, - the 'soi-disant' fashionables and the most violent protectionists - are silenced. It is therefore doubly satisfactory that all should have gone off so well, and without the slightest accident or mishap.</i>

<h3>The death of Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert</h3>
On 20 December, Queen Victoria wrote to her uncle King Leopold of Belgium:</b><br><br>
<i>...to be cut off in the prime of life - to see our pure happy, quiet domestic life, which alone enabled me to bear my much disliked position, cut off at forty-two - when I had hoped with such instinctive certainty that God never would part us, and would let us grow old together ... - is too awful, too cruel!</i>

<h3>Golden Jubilee: 21 June 1887, at Buckingham Palace</h3>
<i>I sat alone (oh! without my beloved husband, for whom this would have been such a<img border="0" src="v11.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" alt="Queen Victoria with her family celebrating her Golden Jubilee" width="233" height="195"> proud day!) where I sat forty-nine years ago and received the homage of the Princes and Peers, but in the old Coronation Chair of Edward III, with the old stone brought from Scotland, on which the old Kings of Scotland used to be crowned. My robes were beautifully draped on the chair. The service was very well done and arranged. The Te Deum, by my darling Albert, sounded beautiful ... When the service was concluded, each of my sons, sons-in-law, grandsons (including little Alfred), and grandsons-in-law, stepped forward, bowed, and in succession kissed my hand, I kissing each; and the same with the daughters, daughters-in-law, grand-daughters, and the granddaughter-in-law. They curtsied as they came up and I embraced them warmly. It was a very moving moment, and tears were in some of their eyes.</i><br><br><br>
