<h3>ALBERT, Prince (1819-61)</h3>
<img src="albert.jpg" width="175" height="290" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="Prince Albert">Born on 26 August 1819 in Schloss Rosenau, near
Coburg, in Germany. His first visit in England was in 1836 when
he was already signed as a possible husband for Queen Victoria. He was her
Coburg cousin(the marriage was promoted by their uncle Leopold). In 1839 Victoria proposed to him and
they were married on 10 February 1840. He influenced the Queen, he was her chief
advisor and, after his death, Victoria took important decisions on the basis of
what she thought Albert would have done, even if the role
he played was not so welcome to all politicians as he wished. His most notable
claim was the Great Exhibition in 1851, but he also participated to decisions as
the one in the midst of the potato famine in 1845, when they continued to export
grain from Ireland while million of Irish starved to death. He also replaced
Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, as Victoria's advisor; he was moralistic,
conscientious and progressive. He died of typhoid on 14 December 1861.
