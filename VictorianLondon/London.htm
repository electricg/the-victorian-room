<h2>LONDON</h2>
Victorian London was the largest, most spectacular city in the world. While Britain was
experiencing the Industrial Revolution, its capital was both reaping the
benefits and suffering the consequences. In 1800 the population of London was
around a million souls. That number would swell to 4.5 million by 1880. While
fashionable areas like Regent and Oxford streets
were growing in the west, new docks supporting the city's place as the world's
trade center were being built in the east. Perhaps the biggest impact on the
growth of London was the coming of the railroad in the 1830s which displaced
thousands and accelerated the expansion of the city.
<img border="0" src="regentstreet.gif" width="304" height="318" alt="Regent Street" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">
The price of this explosive growth and domination of world trade was untold squalor
and filth.<br>
Imagine yourself in the London of the early 19th century. The homes of the upper and
middle class existance is close proximity to areas of unbelievable poverty and
filth. Rich and poor alike are thrown together in the crowded city streets.
Street sweepers attempt to keep the streets clean of manure, the result of
thousands of horse-drawn vehicles.<br>
The city's thousands of chimney pots are belching coal smoke, resulting in soot
which seems to settle everywhere. In many parts of the city raw sewage flows in
gutters that empty into the Thames. Street vendors hawking their wares add to
the cacophony of street noises. Pick-pockets, prostitutes, drunks, beggars, and
vagabonds of every description add to the colorful multitude. <br>
Inside the problem is not much better. Personal cleanliness is not a big priority, nor
is clean laundry. In close, crowded rooms the smell of unwashed bodies is
stifling. It is unbearably hot by the fire, numbingly cold away from it.<br>
At night the major streets are lit with feeble gas lamps. Side and secondary
streets may not be lit at all and link bearers are hired to guide the traveler
to his destination. Inside, a candle or oil lamp struggles against the darkness
and blacken the ceilings.<br>
<img border="0" src="Slums.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Slums" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Until the second half of the 19th century London residents were still drinking water
from the very same portions of the Thames that the open sewers were discharging
into.<br>
Several outbreaks of Cholera in the mid 19th century, along with The Great Stink of
1858, when the stench of the Thames caused Parliament to recess, brought a cry
for action. The link between drinking water tainted with sewage and the
incidence of disease slowly dawned on the Victorians. Dr
John Snow proved that all victims in a Soho area cholera outbreak drew water
from the same Broad
Street pump.<br>
Sir Joseph Bazalgette, chief engineer of the new Metropolitan Board of Works
(1855), put into effect a plan, completed in 1875, which finally provided
adequate sewers to serve the city. In addition, laws were put in effect which
prevented companies supplying drinking water from drawing water from the most
heavily tainted parts of the Thames and required them to provide some type of
filtration.<br>
Before the engineering triumphs of Bazalgette came the architectural triumphs of George
IV's favorite designer, John Nash. Nash designed the broad avenues of Regent
Street, Picadilly Circus, Carlton House Terrace, and Oxford Circus, as well as
the ongoing creation of Buckingham transformation of Buckingham House into a
palace worthy of a monarch.<br>
After the Stage Carriages Act of 1832 the hackney cab was gradually replaced by the
omnibus as a means of moving about the city. By 1900 3000 horse-drawn buses were
carrying 500 million passengers a year. A traffic count in Cheapside and London Bridge
in 1850 showed a thousand vehicles an hour passing through these areas during
the day. All of this added up to an incredible amount of manure which had to be
removed from the streets.<br>
Cattle were driven through the streets until the mid 19th century. The Smithfield
live-cattle market was finally moved to slaughterhouses in Islington in 1855.<br>
The Metropolitan Police, London's first police force, was created by Home Secretary Sir
Robert Peel (hence the name Peelers and, eventually Bobbies) in 1829 with
headquarters in what would become known as Scotland
Yard. The old London watch system, in effect since Elizabethan times, was
eventually abolished.<br>

Just
behind Buckingham Palace the Grosvenor family developed the aristocratic
Belgrave Square. In 1830 land just east of the palace was cleared of the royal
stables to create Trafalgar Square, and the new National Gallery sprang up there
just two years later.<br>
The
early part of the 19th century was the golden age of steam. The first railway in
London was built from London Bridge to Greenwich in 1836, and a great railway
boom followed. Major stations were built at Euston (1837), Paddington (1838),
Fenchurch Street (1841), Waterloo (1848), and King's Cross (1850).<br>
In 1834 the Houses of Parliament at Westminster Palace burned down. They were
gradually replaced by the triumphant mock-Gothic Houses of Parliament designed
by Charles Barry and A.W. Pugin.<br>
<a href="houses-of-parliament.jpg" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="houses-of-parliament_little.JPG" width="300" height="225" alt="Houses of Parliament" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></a>
The clock tower of the Houses of Parliament, known erroneously as Big Ben, was built
in 1859. The origin of the name Big Ben is in some dispute, but there is no
argument that the moniker refers to the bells of the tower, NOT to the large
clock itself.<br>
In 1848 the great Potato Famine struck Ireland. What has this to do with the
history of London? Plenty. Over 100,000 impoverished Irish fled their native
land and settled in London, making at one time up to 20% of the total population
of the city.<br>
Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria was largely responsible for one of the
defining moments of the era that bears his wife's name; the Great Exhibition of
1851. This was the first great world's fair, a showcase of technology and
manufacturing from countries all over the world. The Exhibition was held in Hyde
Park, and the centerpiece was Joseph Paxton's revolutionary iron and glass hall,
dubbed the &quot;Crystal Palace&quot;.<br>
The exhibition was an immense success, with over 200,000 attendees. After the event,
the Crystal Palace was moved to Sydenham, in South London, where it stayed until
it burned to the ground in 1936. The proceeds from the Great Exhibition went
towards the founding of two new permanent displays, which became the Science
Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
The year 1863 saw the completion of the very first underground railway in London,
from Paddington to Farringdon Road. The project was so successful that other
lines soon followed.<br>
But the expansion of transport was not limited to dry land. As the hub of the
British Empire, the Thames was clogged with ships from all over the world, and
London had more shipyards than anyplace on the globe.<br>
For all the economic expansion of the Industrial Revolution, living conditions among
London's poor were appalling. Children as young as 5 were often set to work
begging or sweeping chimneys. Campaigners like Charles Dickens did much to make
the plight of the poor in London known to the literate classes with his novels,
notably Oliver Twist. In 1870 those efforts bore some fruit with the passage of
laws providing compulsory education for children between the ages of 5 and 12.<br>
The Victorian answer to dealing with the poor and indigent was the New Poor Law,
enacted in 1834. Previously it had been the burden of the parishes to take care
of the poor.<br>
The new law required parishes to band together and create regional workhouses where
aid could be applied for. The workhouse was little more than a prison for the
poor. Civil liberties were denied, families were separated, and human dignity
was destroyed. The true poor often went to great lengths to avoid this relief.<br>
With the turn of the century and Queen Victoria's death in 1901 the Victorian period
came to a close. Many of the ills of the 19th century were remedied through
education, technology and social reform... and by the social consciousness
raised by the immensely popular novels of Dickens.
