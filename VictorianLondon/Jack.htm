<h2>JACK THE RIPPER</h2>
<img src="lettera1.jpg" width="216" height="175" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">During the autumn of 1888, a killer terrorized London. He chose as his victims mostly older, decrepit, drink-ridden prostitutes from the East End district of Whitechapel. The name "Jack the Ripper" appeared on a number of letters mailed to the police and to various news agencies.<br><br>
The publication of several of these letters, in the hope that someone would recognize the handwriting, vastly increased the killer's fame. It has never been established that the murderer wrote any of the letters. Nevertheless, without them, the memorable appellation would never have been attached to the killer, and the murders themselves would probably now be long forgotten. He was also called the Whitechapel Murderer and "Leather Apron."<br>
The question of who performed the brutal killings and sexual mutilations has baffled later writers as much as it did the London Metropolitan Police in 1888. Many authors have posited theories, but no one hypothesis has been proven conclusively.<br><br>
It is unclear just how many women the Ripper killed. It is generally accepted that he killed five, though some have written that he murdered only four while others say seven or more. The public, press, and even many junior police officers believed that the Ripper was responsible for nine slayings. The five that are generally accepted as the work of the Ripper are:<br>
<ol><img src="foto1.jpg" width="258" height="231" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">
<li>Mary Ann (Polly) Nichols, murdered Friday, August 31, 1888
<li>Annie Chapman, murdered Saturday, September 8, 1888
<li>Elizabeth Stride, murdered Sunday, September 30, 1888
<li>Catharine Eddowes, also murdered that same date
<li>Mary Jane (Marie Jeanette) Kelly, murdered Friday, November 9, 1888</ol>
All five of these were prostitutes and were killed between early August and early November 1888. The killings took place within a mile area and involved the districts of Whitechapel, Spitalfields, Aldgate, and the City of London proper. They were killed outdoors and there is no evidence to suggest that any of them knew each other. They varied in both age and appearance. Most were drunk or thought to be drunk at the time they were killed.<br><br>
<img src="mapollondon.gif" width="410" height="276" border="0" alt=""><br><br>The following letter, written in red ink, gave the notorious murderer his name. It was received by Central News on September 27, 1888 and was addressed to The Boss, Central News Office.<br><br>
<font color="Red">25 Sept: 1888<br>
Dear Boss<br>
I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track. That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits. I am down on whores and I shant quit ripping them till I do get buckled. Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to squeal. How can they catch me now. I love my work and want to start again. You will soon hear of me with my funny little games. I saved some proper red stuff in a ginger beer bottle over the last job to write with but it went thick like glue and I cant use it. Red ink is fit enough I hope ha.ha. The next job I do I shall clip. The lady's ears off and send to the Police officers just for jolly wouldn't you. Keep this letter back till I do a bit more work then give it out straight. My knife's so nice and sharp I want to get to work right away if I get a chance.<br>
Good luck.<br><br>
Yours truly<br><br>
Jack the Ripper<br><br>

Don't mind me giving the trade name</font><br><br>
Then on the same letter, written horizontally was the following message:<br><br>
<div align="center"><font color="Red">wasn't good enough to post this before I got all the red ink off my hands curse it. No luck yet. They Say I'm a doctor. now ha_ha</font></div><br><br><div align="center"><img src="lettera2.jpg" width="260" height="399" border="0" alt=""></div><br>
The 'Ripper' would confine his attacks on impoverished women, forced to rely on prostitution as a means of income. As such, it was easy to procure victims who were always in dire need of funds.<br>
All the attacks occurred during the many dark evenings of 19th century London, and with the exception of his final known attack Mary Kelly, all occurred in the proximity of London's East End streets, performing his activities in the many darkened alleys and alcoves.<br>
The 'Ripper`s' choice of weapon was a straight razor blade, strong enough to use as a stabbing/slashing implement, but flexible enough to use in the many dismemberment activities employed. This can also imply the use of some form of medicinal scalpel.<br><br>
<img src="PRINCEALBERTVICTOR.gif" width="74" height="114" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">There were many different suspects; one of them was<br>
<b>HRH Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence</b>.<br>
Scandal has always been welcome at the expense of royalty, which is exactly what happened to Queen Victoria's grandson and the spate of East End murders. It has been suggested that Prince Albert, directly or indirectly, had knowledge of who was involved in the murders. Others who may have been instigators of the murders themselves include <b>Sir William Gull</b> (the royal physician), <b>Walter Sickert</b> (an artist) and <b>John Netley</b> (a royal coachman in service). The murders were apparently committed to prevent any "loose ends" involving a Prince's indiscretion, an illegitimate child and future blackmail attempts. If this is so, why then did five women die if only one was required to be eliminated, of which the identity was known? and why were they killed so gruesomely?
