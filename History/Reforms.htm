<h2>REFORMS</h2>
The first major reform of the Corn Laws took place during the ministry of the
Duke of Wellington in 1828. The price of corn was no longer fixed, but
tied to a sliding scale that allowed foreign grain to be imported freely. When
domestic grain was sold at 73 shillings per quarter or above, and at increasing
tariffs the further the domestic price dropped below 73 shillings. The effect of
this reform was negligible.<br>
Because the price of corn was kept artificially high by the Corn Laws,
paupers risked starvation and could not feed their children. In order to solve
this problem, the children were declared destitute and, forced to separate from
their families, were sent to work in parish run workhouse in return for
which they received barely enough food to survive.<br>

<h3>Trade Union Act</h3>
The Trade Union Movement, however, which had at first met with strong
opposition from the Government and had finally been legalized in 1825-26, got
stronger. Slowly, thanks to the ability of a few leaders, strong Craft
Unions were formed. The first Trade Union Congress met in 1868. In 1857 the <i>Trade
Union Act, </i>passed by Disraeli's government, finally sanctioned the legality
and importance of the Unions.<br>
