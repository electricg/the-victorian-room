<h2>THE CHARTIST MOVEMENT</h2>
The Chartist Movement had at its core the so-called "People's Charter" of
1838. This document, created for the London Working Men's Association, was
primarily the work of William Lovet. The chartist was a public petition aimed at
redressing omissions from the electoral Reform Act of 1832. It quickly became a
rallying point for working class agitators for social ills.Chartism was the first specifically working-class movement, although 
"Chartism" and "working class" are both terms that cover regional variations and 
all types of working men: artisans to factory workers. They also cover diversity 
within industries, setting workers against workers: cotton/wool; factory/hand
workers.For these supporters
the People's Charter was the first step towards a social and economic utopia.In
demanding so much the supporters of the charter probably ensured its downfall,
for the number of demands probably diluted support for any single demand<br>
The main causes of the Chartist Movement were:<br>
Industrial and agricultural workers disliked the new conditions of 19th-century factory discipline, low wages, periodic unemployment and high prices. There was much resentment at the widening gulf between rich and poor. There was discontent because of exploitation in factories. Traditional hand-workers were facing extreme distress in the face of competition from machines. There were few alternatives: they could join the factory workers or go in the workhouse. Grievances existed in mutually hostile groups from declining and rising industries.<br>
The 1815 Corn Laws and a protectionist economy still prevailed despite
Huskisson's reforms of the 1820s. The Corn Laws kept food prices artificially high and therefore depressed domestic markets for manufactures - thus depressing employment. Foreign markets were also undercut, further reducing factory output and exports. Reforms were also needed in banking, customs and taxation. The 1830s also saw a series of bad harvests.<br>
The working classes had given massive support to the middle-class campaign for the 1832
Reform Act because they had been drawn by the possibility of the franchise, or legislation to help them. The working class was dissatisfied because the 1832 Act did not enfranchise them, and also they were unhappy with the 'finality' attitude of the Whigs and Tory hostility to reform, all of which offered no prospect of the future achievement of the vote for the working classes.<br>
Subsequent Whig reforms came as a bitter disappointment and actually hurt the working man. Middle-class representation led to middle-class legislation, so Chartists sought a political solution to their economic and social problems. Whig reforms were institutional rather than social or economic: 

<UL>
<LI>the 1833 Factory Act regulated child labour but <U>not</U> adult hours, and applied only to textile factories. It was a bitter disappointment to the 10-hour movement. 
<LI>the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act treated poverty as a crime and aimed at cutting poor rates. Workhouses were hated - they were known as "poor law bastilles" - because of the brutal conditions. The Anti-Poor-Law campaign of 1834-36 failed.</LI></UL>



&nbsp;<br>
The People's Charter outlined 6 major demands for reform.<br>
These were:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Institution of a secret ballot</li>
  <li>General elections to be held annually</li>
  <li>Members of Parliament not to be required to own property</li>
  <li>MPs to be paid a salary</li>
  <li>Electoral districts of equal size</li>
  <li>Universal male suffrage</li>
</ul>
<a href="javascript:popWin1('moral.jpg', 'Moral', 380, 465, 'false')"><img border="0" src="moral_small.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" alt="The Charter" width="284" height="350"></a>The first gathering of Chartist delegates was held in London on February 4,
1839.Although 53 delegates came to London, they were aware of laws forbidding
gatherings of more than 50 men, and so they took care that the number was present
at any time.<br>
At this gathering the nature of the divisions that were to trouble the
Movement were apparent, as some delegators favoured violence if necessary, some
favoured a general strike, and these were even talking of electing a &quot;people's
parliament&quot;. In other words, in common with many social movements, they
could figure out what they were against, but had a harder time figuring out what
to do about it.<br>
The Convention did adopt the motto &quot;peaceably if we may, forcibly if we
must&quot;, which may have frightened those more moderate middle -class
members who might have been persuaded to support their cause. Agitation
continued throughout the spring of 1839, and government troops were used to
ensure order in some areas of the country, notably the north.<br>
Chartism failed for a number of reasons:<br><br>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top width="50%">
      <b>London</b> - philosophical radicals; craftsmen; skilled artisans.<br>
      <b>Leaders</b>: constitutional reformers, moderates, like Lovett and 
    Place.</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width="50%">
      <b>Manchester</b> - cotton factory workers.<br>
      <b>Leaders</b>: violent proto-Marxist revolutionaries. Some were embryonic 
      socialists</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top width="50%">
      <b>Yorkshire</b> - domestic woollen workers.<br>
      <b>Leaders</b>: physical force men, especially Feargus O'Connor</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width="50%">
      <b>Derbyshire</b> and <b>Nottinghamshire</b>: Luddite types.<br>
      Social and economic reform wanted by the led. Little political 
      motivation</TD></TR></TABLE><br>
Most obviously, it failed to
gather support in Parliament not surprising when you consider the threat it
posed to the self-interest of those in power.Equally important, it failed to
gather support from the middle-classes.<br>
The demands of Chartism were too radical for many of the middle classes, who
were comfortable enough with the status quo.The repel of the Corn Laws helped
improve the economic climate of Britain, and there was less interest in radical
reforms.As well, the mid-19th century spawned a variety of social reform groups
with special aims, and the Chartist movement lost many of its members in favour
of these
other groups.<br>
