When King William IV died, he was succeeded by his niece Victoria in 1837.<br>
She was to reign for 64 years and was to become the symbol of a whole era,
which was to be called &quot; the Victorian Age&quot;. When Victoria ascended to the throne she
found a country in a difficult situation: there was much discontent among the
working class, owing to a slump in industry and to a period of bad crops, which
led to about 10 years of widespread misery (the &quot;hungry forties&quot;) .<br>
What is usually referred to as the "Victorian Age" covered a period of time
longer than the actual of Queen Victoria. It fact, it can, be said to have ended
some years after her death, also including what is called the "Edwardian Age"
(in reference to king Edward VII), which more or less covered the few years
between Victoria's death and the First World War.<br>
On the whole, it was a complex age, marked by political, social and religious
unrest. The country underwent a gradual but steady process of democratization.
The class that benefited most from the changes of the time was the middle class.
Made up of manufacturers, merchants and bankers, it increased in power and took
the reins of the government, also favoured by the progress in industry and
technological fields and the resulting prosperity.<br>
Colonial expansion was fostered, scientific research was encouraged and
transports spread and improved. The belief that happiness could be reached
through technical progress made for optimism throughout the country.
