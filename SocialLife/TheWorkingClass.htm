<h2>THE WORKING CLASS</h2>
Between 1850 and 1870 salaries increased slightly more than the cost of
living. There was the London of the rich, the West End, and the London of
the poor, the East End. The social rejects, the starving, the slaves on
piece-work lived in unsanitary hovels, in conditions of absolute
degradation. A list of the laws passed after 1832 concerning the working day
shows how many concessions or victories, depending on one's point of view, the
working classes had. The norm in 1833 was a working day that began at half past
five in the morning and finished at half past eight in the evening. For children
between thirteen and eighteen the working day could not be longer than twelve
hours,distributed throughout the day. From nine to thirteen years the daily
maximum was eight hours and minors could not work on night shifts. Another Act,
in 1844, limited women to twelve hours a day and reduced minors to six and a
half hours.
<h3>The poor</h3>
<img border="0" src="oakum1.jpg" width="359" height="289" hspace="20" align="right" alt="">London's docks expanded rapidly. Smaller boats, mainly carrying cargoes such
as coal and grain from other British ports, still used riverside wharves, but
congestion on the Thames was such that purpose-built docks were needed to handle
the big ocean-going vessels. Whole new villages and communities grew up to serve
the docks, but poverty was endemic because the wages were extremely low. London
became an increasingly stratified city, with a relatively prosperous West End
and a poor East End. Model dwellings to house the poor began to appear, but
never enough to make any serious dent in the growing problem of the slums.
