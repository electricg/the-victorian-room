<h2>THE WORKHOUSE</h2>
Workhouses were institutions for paupers. Workhouses were supported by
public funds, or by parish, or "union" funds. In workhouses paupers were
fed and lodged and set to work. This expression of public charity, though, was
hardly better than prison: it was the last step before starving. Dirty bleak
places inhabited by the areas of society, workhouses were the dustbin of
Victorian society.

<h3>Why did people enter the Workhouse?</h3>
People usually lived there because they were too poor, old or ill to support
themselves, because they lost their work during periods of high unemployment
and couldn't provide care for themselves when they became elderly or sick. Unmarried
pregnant women were often disowned by their families and the workhouse was the
only place they could go during and after the birth of their child. Workhouses,
though, were never prisons, and entry into them was generally a voluntary
although often painful decision.

<h3>Inside the workhouse</h3>
The workhouse was like a small self-contained village. Apart
from the basic rooms such as a dining-hall for eating, and dormitories for
sleeping the workhouses often had their own bakery, laundry, tailor's and
shoe-maker's, vegetable gardens and orchards, and even a piggery for rearing
pigs. There would also be school-room, nurseries, fever-wards for the sick, a
chapel, and a dead-room or mortuary. Once inside the workhouse, inmate's only
possessions were their uniform and the bed they had in the large dormitory. Beds
were simply constructed with a wooden or iron frame, and could be as little as two
feet across. Bed-sharing was also very common.<BR><br>

<h3>The daily routine</h3>
The daily routine for inmates proposed by the Poor Law
Commissioners was as follows:<BR><br>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td width="12%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="12%">Hour of Rising</td>

<h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
There were strict <a href="WorkhouseLife2.htm">rules</a> inside the workhouses. These were often
printed and prominently displayed in the workhouse, and also read out aloud each
week so that the illiterate could have no excuse for disobeying them.

<h3>Workhouse Uniform</h3>
Workhouse clothing could be either bought-in or else made by workhouse
inmates themselves as a work task. It was usually made from fairly coarse
materials with the emphasis being on hard-wearing rather than on comfort and
fitting.<br><br>

<h3>Diet</h3>
<img border="0" src="StPancras1.jpg" width="435" height="333" alt="" hspace="20" align="right">The <a href="Diet.htm">diet</a> to workhouse in mates was particularly detailed. For
example:
<ul>
<li>7 Ounces of Meat when dressed, without Bones, to every grown Person
<li>2 Ounces of Butter
<li>4 Ounces of Cheese
<li>1 Pound of Bread
<li>3 Pints of Beer</ul>
From 1835 onwards, the Poor Law Commissioners issued sample
dietary tables for use in Union workhouse.<br>
<a href="javascript:popWin('BabyFarming.htm')">Children</a>
and the aged or infirm had a slightly different diet, usually with more
meat-based meals, and with inclusion of milk or tea. The main constituent of the
workhouse diet was bread. At breakfast it was supplemented by gruel or porridge.
Workhouse broth was usually the water used for boiling the dinner meat. Tea,
often without milk, was often provided for the aged and infirm at breakfast,
together with a small amount of butter. Supper was usually similar to breakfast.<BR>
Meals were usually eaten, in silence, in a large dining-hall
which often doubled-up as a chapel.<BR>
The <a href="javascript:popWin('ClassificationOfInmates.htm')">inmates</a> commonly sat in rows all facing the same way, with
men men and women separated.<BR><br>

<h3>Work</h3>
<img border="0" src="stoneyard.jpg" width="444" height="298" alt="" align="right" hspace="20">
Inmates were given a variety of work to perform, much of which
was involved in running the workhouse. The women mostly did domestic jobs such
as cleaning, or helping in the kitchen or laundry. Some workhouses had workshop
for sewing, spinning and weaving or other local trades. Others had their own
vegetable gardens where the inmates worked to provide food for the workhouse. In
rural areas, inmates were sometimes used for agriculture labour. Stone-breaking
was a task often given to male inmates.<BR>
By 1930, workhouses were officially abolished.
