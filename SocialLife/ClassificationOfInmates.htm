<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF INMATES</h3>
After 1834, inmates were strictly segregated into seven classes:
<ol type="1">
	<li>Aged or infirm men.
	<li>Able bodied men, and youths above 13.
	<li>Youths and boys above seven years old and under 13.
	<li>Aged or infirm women.
	<li>Able-bodied women and girls above 16.
	<li>Girls above seven years old and under 16.
	<li>Children under seven years of age.
</ol>
Each class had its own area of the workhouse. Husbands, wives and children
were separated as soon as they entered the workhouse and could be punished if
they even tried to speak to one another. (In 1847 this was relaxed slightly in
the case of married couples over the age of sixty who could request to share a
separate bedroom)
