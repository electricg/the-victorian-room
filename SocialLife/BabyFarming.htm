<h3>BABY FARMING</h3>
Poor children were not only shamelessly exploited in the hardest jobs (mining, textile industry), they could also be starved and beaten to death. Baby farming consisted more or less in giving the child to be kept and looked after for a variable sum to people who, in their turn, would either &lt;sell&gt; the child to a professional beggar, or to a thief for proper training. Children could also be sold out as servants.
