<h3>JOHN RUSKIN (1819-1900)</h3>
<img border="0" src="ruskin.jpg" width="183" height="72" hspace="20" alt="John Ruskin" align="right">John Ruskin was born on 8 February 1819 at 54 Hunter Street, London, the only
child of Margaret and John James Ruskin. His father, a prosperous, self-made man
who was a founding partner of Pedro Domecq sherries, collected art and
encouraged his son's literary activities, while his mother, a devout <a href="http://65.107.211.206/religion/evangel2.html" target="_blank">evangelical
Protestant</a>, early dedicated her son to the service of God and devoutly
wished him to become an Anglican bishop. Ruskin, who received his education at
home until the age of twelve, rarely associated with other children and had few
toys. During his sixth year he accompanied his parents on the first of many
annual tours of the Continent. Encouraged by his father, he published his first
poem, &quot;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water,&quot; at the age of eleven, and four
years later his first prose work, an article on the waters of the Rhine.<br>
In 1836, the year he matriculated as a gentleman-commoner at Christ Church,
Oxford, he wrote a pamphlet defending the painter <a href="http://65.107.211.206/painting/turner/index.html" target="_blank">Turner</a>
against the periodical critics, but at the artist's request he did not publish
it. While at Oxford (where his mother had accompanied him) Ruskin associated
largely with a wealthy and often rowdy set but continued to publish poetry and
criticism; and in 1839 he won the Oxford Newdigate Prize for poetry. The next
year, however, suspected consumption led him to interrupt his studies and travel,
and he did not receive his degree until 1842, when he abandoned the idea of
entering the ministry. This same year he began the first volume of <b>Modern
Painters</b> after reviewers of the annual Royal Academy exhibition had again
savagely treated Turner's works, and in 1846, after making his first trip abroad
without his parents, he published the second volume, which discussed his
theories of beauty and imagination within the context of figural as well as
landscape painting. [1/2]<br>
On 10 April 1848 Ruskin married Euphemia Chalmers Gray, and the next year he
published <b>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</b>, after which he and Effie set
out for Venice. In 1850 he published <b>The King of the Golden River</b>, which
he had written for Effie nine years before, and a volume of poetry, and in the
following year, during which Turner died and Ruskin made the acquaintance of the
<a href="http://65.107.211.206/painting/prb/1.html" target="_blank">Pre-Raphaelites</a>,
the first volume of <b>The Stones of Venice</b>. The final two volumes appeared
in 1853, the summer of which saw Millais, Ruskin, and Effie together in Scotland,
where the artist painted Ruskin's portrait. The next year his wife left him and
had their marriage annulled on grounds of non-consummation, after which she
later married Millais. During this difficult year, Ruskin defended the
Pre-Raphaelites, became close to Rossetti, and taught at the Working Men's
College.<br>
In 1855 Ruskin began <b>Academy Notes</b>, his reviews of the annual
exhibition, and the following year, in the course of which he became acquainted
with the man who later became his close friend, the American Charles Eliot
Norton, he published the third and fourth volumes of <b>Modern Painters</b> and <b>The
Harbours of England</b>. He continued his immense productivity during the next
four years, producing <b>The Elements of Drawing</b> and <b>The Political
Economy of Art</b> in 1857, <b>The Elements of Perspective</b> and <b>The Two
Paths</b> in 1859, and the fifth volume of <b>Modern Painters</b> and the
periodical version of <b>Unto This Last</b> in 1860. During 1858, in the midst
of this productive period, Ruskin decisively abandoned the evangelical
Protestantism which had so shaped his ideas and attitudes, and he also met Rose
La Touche, a young Irish Protestant girl with whom he was later to fall deeply
and tragically in love.<br>
Throughout the 1860s Ruskin continued writing and lecturing on social and
political economy, art, and myth, and during this decade he produced the <b>Fraser's
Magazine</b> &quot;Essays on Political Economy&quot; (1863); revised as <b>Munera
Pulveris</b>, 1872), <b>Sesame and Lilies</b> (1865), <b>The Grown of Wild Olive</b>
(1866), <b>The Ethics of the Dust</b> (1866), <b>Time and Tide</b>, and <font size="2">[2/3]</font>
<b>The Queen of the Air</b> (1869), his study of Greek myth. The next decade,
which begins with his delivery of the inaugural lecture at Oxford as Slade
Professor of Fine Art in February 1870, saw the beginning of <b>Fors Clavigera</b>,
a series of letters to the working men of England, and various works on art and
popularized science. His father had died in 1864 and his mother in 1871 at the
age of ninety.<br>
In 1875 Rose la Touche died insane, and three years later Ruskin suffered his
first attack of mental illness and was unable to testify during the Whistler
trial when the artist sued him for libel. In 1880 Ruskin resigned his Oxford
Professorship, suffering further attacks of madness in 1881 and 1882; but after
his recovery he was re-elected to the Slade Professorship in 1883 and delivered
the lectures later published as <b>The Art of England</b> (1884). In 1885 he
began <b>Praeterita</b>, his autobiography, which appeared intermittently in
parts until 1889, but he became increasingly ill, and Joanna Severn, his cousin
and heir, had to bring him home from an 1888 trip to the Continent. He died on
20 January 1900 at Brantwood, his home near Coniston Water.
