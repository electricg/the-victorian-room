<h3>ROBERT ADAM (1728-1792)</h3>
<img border="0" src="adam.jpg" width="137" height="221" align="right" alt="Robert Adam" hspace="20">Robert Adam was born in Kirkaldy, son of the Edinburgurgh architect William Adam,and studies at Edinburgh University. Together with William Chambers, he was architect of the layout of Portland Place and Lansdowne House, and the facade of the Admiralty in Whitehall. In Scotland is his Old Quad in Edinburgh University. His famous Adelphi near the Strand was demolished in 1936, but parts of the three terraced streets associated with it, just off the Strand, still survive, more exciting inside that out. In fact Adam was particularly known for his interiors based on classical decoration and an accessible example in London is Kenwood House, home of the Iveagh Collection of paintings, Which Adam entirely remodelled.
