The first room you come upon after entering the foyer is the
dining room. <img src="dining-room.jpg" width="188" height="124" alt="Dining Room" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Early in the era, this <a name="dining room"><b>dining room</b></a> was located in the
basement with the kitchen. It was once believed food digested better in the
dark. Later, the room was moved to the first floor. You’ll notice the
<a href="Furniture.htm">furniture</a> is a dark wood and very ornate in style. The table is open fully to
accommodate guests. You will usually find a carved &quot;sideboard&quot; (china
closet) and buffet. There is also a dinner wagon which is used to wheel food and
drinks to the table from the dumbwaiter.<br><br>
<img src="kitchen.jpg" width="190" height="144" alt="Kitchen" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Like most Victorian <a name="kitchen"><b>kitchens</b></a>, this is located in the
basement to keep the rest of the house free from odors and grease. Here you will
find one large table and several smaller ones which are used to chop food, roll
dough and place dry dishes on. In addition, to the stove, you will find a
fireplace which is also used for cooking.<br>
The dishes and groceries are stored in wooden cabinets with
glass doors. The pies are kept in a small cabinet called a &quot;pie safe&quot;.<br>
In the scullery would be a copper, sink, draining board and a mangle.<br><br>
<img src="parlor.jpg" width="174" height="125" alt="Parlor" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The <a name="parlor"><b>parlor</b></a>, the most formal room in the house, is used
only on Sundays for family gatherings and entertaining guests. Most parlors are
decorated in deep, rich colors of burgundy or dark green.<br>
Heavy drapes adorn the windows to prevent the sun from fading
the <a href="Furniture.htm">furniture</a> and rugs. People are now beginning to move away from the darker
colors to creams and blues. The fireplace is used to keep the room comfortable
in winter.<br>
The room’s crowded nature serves two purposes: a. to show
the family’s wealth and good taste, and b. to have enough seats for all of one’s
guests. It is considered rude for a man to offer his seat to a lady as the
cushion might still be warm.<br><br>
<img src="drawing-room.jpg" width="173" height="132" alt="Drawing Room" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">This is one end of the <a name="drawing room"><b>drawing room</b></a> which is used for
many purposes. It is used to entertain when there are large dinner parties. The
men retreat here after dinner to smoke their cigars, engage in conversation and
play billiards.<br>
At the other end of the room, there’s another seating area.
Along one wall is a fairly large bookcase filled with books from ceiling to the
floor and a desk. Sitting against another of the walls, there is the piano.<br>
This room is mainly used to read, sew and tend to one’s
household and other business matters.<br><br>
<img src="bed-chamber.jpg" width="160" height="183" alt="Bed Chamber" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Victorians consider bedrooms or <a name="bedrooms"><b>bed chambers</b></a>, as they
are called, very private. They are found on a second or third floor. They are
never viewed by guests.<br>
The furnishings, in addition to the bed, wardrobe, bureau and
wash stand, often include a chair, table and settee.<br><br>
One or two rooms might be set aside as a <a name="nursery"><b>nursery</b></a> and/or school room.<br>
A large table in the middle of the room would be used for both meals and games.<br>
A high brass fender would keep the children away from the fire.<br>
There would be a screen for use when bathing, a baby bath, cot, and chairs for children and adults.<br>
The floor would be covered with linoleum, with perhaps a rough and hard wearing carpet in a dark grey or brown.<br><br>
<img src="water-closet.jpg" width="192" height="145" alt="Water Closet" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">People who have an indoor <a name="water closet"><b>water closet</b></a> are quite fortunate. There’s a tub in wood and the toilet is hidden from the general view.<br>
