<h2>NEOCLASSICISM</h2>
The birth of English NeoClassical arcchitecture is mainly due to <a href="javascript:popWin('Adam.htm')">Sir Robert Adam</a> who travelled in Italy and Greece and, coming back to Britain, recreated and recombined the antique forms in a new context.<br><br>

Artistic exposition diversified in the second half of the 18th century. Its expression continued to be primarily classical, but eclecticism now had a wider base; the rigid rules of palladianism were relaxed.

The spirit of experimentation with the development of new sources and ideas was the result of what happened at the time: extended travel overseas to more distant countries and the increase in wealth at home deriving from the current revolutions in both agriculture and industry.<br><br>
By 1800 nearly all English architecture reflected the neoclassical spirit. After 1800 the interest in the revival of Greek forms intensified and the stream of buildings based either wholly or in part on Greek models continued well into the 19th century. One of the earliest was William Wilkins' Downing College, Cambridge (1806-1811) with details copied from the Erechteum on the Acropolis at Athens. following this were Sir Rober Smirke's Covent Garden Theater, London (1809), Wilkins' Grange Park, Hampshire (1809), Smirke's British Museum (1824-1847) and St Pancras Church (1819-1822) by William and Henry Inwood.<br>
The design of Regent's Street and Regent's Park with its palatial terraces by John Nash in the second decade of the 19th century exemplify the kind of town planning associated with the mood of Neoclassicism.

Palladianism covered four decades when the designs of Palladio and his followers were considered the only &quot;correct&quot; classical style. Unlike Baroque, which was a way of life, Palladianism was purely architectural and intellectual. The Palladian school returned to a quiet, restrained classical form with little decorative enrichment apart from the orders. English Palladianism had three bases. First, the work of Andrea Palladio; secondly, the design of Vitruvius, the architect of Republic Rome and, thirdly, Inigo Jones.The whole scheme was symmetrical, with careful attention to Roman classical proportion, orders and details.The principal rooms in the large houses of period were on the piano nobile. The living rooms included a dining room, a drawing room, a library and upstairs, there were bedrooms and dressing rooms. Kitchens and servants quarter were relegated to basement and attic.
