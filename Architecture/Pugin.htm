<h3>AUGUSTUS CHARLES PUGIN (1812-1852)</h3>
<img border="0" src="Pugin1.gif" width="113" height="134" hspace="20" alt="Charles Pugin" align="right">Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (whose most famous work is the entire decorative detailing, inside and out, of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster) worked in Gothic studies in the Gothic houses he built for himself. In these he lived a Gothic, or Medieval life with his Gothic decor, Gothic diet and Gothic family. Immersed in a neo-Medieval atmosphere he was able to design an astonishing number of buildings during his short life (he died, exhausted and mad, aged 40, in 1852), each thought out in the most minute detail. And each designed by no one but Pugin alone. He scorned the idea of employing an assistant, crying &quot;A clerk, a clerk,&nbsp; when I would kill him in a week&quot;.<br>
Did Pugin's greatness lie partly in the fact that he lived and worked in an atmosphere that matched and mirrored his architecture? It probably did.
