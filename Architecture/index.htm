During the Victorian Age the movement of people from country to town accelerated and the higher birthrate and better medical care resulted in an increase in the population. To provide houses, factories, schools, colleges and civic buildings for the larger number of people a tremendous building drive was necessary. Speculators bought land on the outskirts of industrial cities and built houses, packed densely in the familiar back-to-back style of the northern and Midlands towns of 1860's.<br><br>
The 18th century was Britain's &quot;golden age&quot; in domestic architecture and the arts. Probably the most important factor in creating the most suitable climate for the flowering of these arts was the patronage of the aristocracy.The aristocracy was knowledgeable and had good taste. The aristocrats were numerous and so could employ large numbers of architects, artists and craftsmen and, thanks to their European travels, they knew exactly what they wished to create and possess.<br><br>

The 18th century was the &quot;Age of Enlightenment&quot;. Inigo Jones and, above all, Andrea Palladio became the only sources of true architectural enlightenment, until they were eclipsed in the 1760's.<br><br>

But not all Victorian town housing was of slum potential. Between the two extremes of large houses and back-to-back dwellings a quantity of middle class homes was also created. These were often built in terrace rows too.<br><br>

In style the Victorian Age was one in which previous designs were revived. The two fundamental types of buildings - Classical and Gothic - were used in all their forms.
