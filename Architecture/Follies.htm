<h2>FOLLIES</h2><img border="0" src="LeithHillTower.jpg" width="230" height="243" hspace="20" align="right" alt="Leith Hill Tower" vspace="20">
Unusual buildings known as follies can be found throughout Great Britain; they serve no useful function, they don't commemorate anything, they are usually found in out-of-the-way location and are often uninhabitable.<br><br>
A folly is an architectural construction which isn't what it appears to be. Although most of the building we now call follies are a part of English garden and landscapes design, a folly need not to be part of a garden.<br><br>
Many follies are constructed as tangible symbols for certain ideas or ideals.The trend towards classical ruins in landscape architecture was brought about in part by popularity of The Grand Tour in the 17th century. Young men (only occasionally young women) toured Greece and Italy, and many came away romantically impressed with the ruined classical building they saw there. Back in England, they attempted to introduce many of the same themes they thought they had seen on their travels.

Some of britain's more popular follies include: the Pineapple, a summerhouse in Dunmore Park, Scotland, which has its own private garden, and the Pigsty on Robin Hood's Bay, Yorkshire, built by a local nobleman at the end of the 19th century in the form of a greek temple to accommodate two of his valuable pigs. Then there's the Egyptian House, the sugar loaf, a spire built by Mad Jack Fuller to win a bet, and the Hadlow tower, Kent, built in 1850 by Walter by Walter May in the shapes of a wedding cake as constant reminder to his wife, who had eloped with another man.<br><br>
Constructed, by the fifth Earl of Dunmore as a garden folly, with a keystone dated 1761, the Pineapple is built into the north wall of the walled garden, where it forms a focal point, standing 45 feet above ground level. It is a remarkably accurate rendering of a pineapple, with each of the gently curving leaves being drained separately in order to prevent frost damage to the delicate masonry. The Pineapple more than lives up to its description as a &quot;classical essay of novel conception&quot;, with its ingeniously constructed and incredibly realistic massive stone leaves cantilevered out from the main structure. Pineapples were scarcely seen at this time except by the very rich, so this stone copy must have astounded and bemused the local population.<br><br>
The architect of the &quot;Pineapple&quot; is unknown. Tradition ascribes it to Sir William Chambers, who designed similar work at Kew Gardens, but he was working in London at the time it was built and it is not mentioned in his writings, as such a remarkable building surely have been.
